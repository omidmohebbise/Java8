#Flight Recorder
Flight Recorder which earlier used to be a commercial add-on in Oracle JDK is now open-sourced since Oracle JDK is itself not free anymore. JFR is a profiling tool used to gather diagnostics and profiling data from a running Java application. Its performance overhead is negligible and thatâ€™s usually below 1%. Hence it can be used in production applications.
