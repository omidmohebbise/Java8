##Epsilon: A No-Op Garbage Collector
Unlike the JVM GC which is responsible for allocating memory and releasing it, Epsilon only allocates memory. It allocates memory for the following things:

- Performance testing.
- Memory pressure testing.
- VM interface testing.
- Extremely short lived jobs.
- Last-drop latency improvements.
- Last-drop throughput improvements.

Now Elipson is good only for test environments. It will lead to OutOfMemoryError in production and crash the applications. The benefit of Elipson is no memory clearance overhead. Hence itâ€™ll give an accurate test result of performance and we can no longer GC for stopping it. Note: This is an experimental feature.
